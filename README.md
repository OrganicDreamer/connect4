# connect4
A quick implementation of connect 4, which can be modified for different grid sizes, colours, etc. Assuming Python 3.4+ is already downloaded and installed, this should work out of the box.

1. Make sure pygame is already installed. From command line:

pip install pygame

2. Navigate to this directory and run main script. From command line:

python playConnect4.py
